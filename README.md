# React with Redux and Firebase

This repo is a result of completing a tutorial created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg">The Net Ninja</a> in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iWstfXntcj8f-dFZ4UtlN3">React, Redux & Firebase App Tutorial</a>.<br>
The app is a simple project management tool with authentication and cloud functions. The live version is available at https://mario-plan.ruga.pl/<br>
Both the teacher and tutorial itself are great and I recommend it!
